        <h1 class="title">Environmental Affects</h1>
        <p>Technology has had an almost entirely negative affect on the enviroment and our planet. It really makes you question if we are just digging ourselves a slow grave as a species or if the benefits of technology are really worth the harm to inflict on our surroundings.</p>
        <p>The beginings of our dabbling in technology can be traced back to the industrial revolution, since then the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has only been increasing as we are burning fossil fuels to create the energy to satiate our technological appetite.</p>

        <p>This image is from <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide">climate.gov</a> and shows the continued increase of carbon emissions per year. This has a huge imapact on our enivronment as the carbon cycle is the backbone of all life and by increasing the levels of carbon in the atomsphere beyond what is normal contributes to extreme weather and climate change.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Make a difference</h2>

        <p>In 2009 Google stated that each query is worth <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html">"0.2 grams of CO2"</a> however Google has also stated that they are <a href="https://sustainability.google/intl/en-GB/carbon-free">carbon neurtal</a> however this is almost cirtainly green washing and doesn't take into considerting the "e-waste" of their products there aren't being recycled and are materials are being sourced in unsustainable ways. So how can you make a difference if you can't rely, and shouldn't rely on companies?</p>
        <p>So how can you make use out of technology whilst impacting the environment as little as possible? Here are some of our tips:
            <ol>
                <li>RRR (Reduce, Resuse, Recycle) - Do you really need the newest phone? Is the laptop getting a bit slow? Are there some components in your device which could be given another life somewhere else? You don't need to own the latest techonology, this has is a narative fed to you by big tech businesses. Have you considered putting a lighter operating system on your laptop that is running a bit slow, It doesn't need thrown out, some of the linux distrobutions are very easy to use (and possibly even easier than windows or macos) for instance check out <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>. If you do end up replacing your laptop why not check and see if anyone is need of a laptop, you might just make their day.</li>
                <li>Litter Picking - This one may seem obscure but ultimatley you are improving the enviroment in another way. It may not be directly improving the state of carbon emitions and recycling but it's a postive for the environment.</li>
                <li>Inform others - By doing this you are raising awareness for the issue and making people more environmentally conscious.</li>
            </ol>
