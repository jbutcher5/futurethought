            <h2 id="replace-us" class="sub-title">Is it likely that AI will replace us?</h2>

            <p>This is very fair question to ask and the answer is almost certainly will. However, we must not be scared of it and we must not reject it. Take the calculator for example, it put many people out of a job however is this really a problem because it never replaced the job of the mathematician it enhanced their capabilities. However people are scared because their lively hood is on the line, their job, their profession. What we need is a world where people don't worry about their financial situtation and people can just work because they enjoy doing it and care for the people around them not because if they don't they can't survive.</p>

            <h2 id="accidents" class="sub-title">Self-driving Cars</h2>

            <p>Self-driving cars attest the point above, they are feat of human engineering however they don't come with their own bag of issues. For example who is reponsible if the car were to crash and was driving itself at the time, the manufactuer trained the ai so they are responsible for any failures in it however it was the driver who was using the car. The solution is to enforce drivers to be in control of the at all times even when it is driving itself. This just shows that AI really isn't ready for our society.</p>
            <p>The problem with self-drivings cars is that they are a bit of a made up problem with this solution of self-driving cars. Transport exists where you don't need to be concern with driving, busses, trains, cycling and walking all are much more effetive and cheaper means of transport yet we keep trying to push against the grain with cars that are ineffective, inefficient, expensive and polute our enviroment be that in the fumes they release or at the end of their life being scrapped and sent to some third world country where they are "scrapped" and end up polluting the water supply. See <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54665545">this article</a> from the BBC on the reality of shipping old cars to poorer countries.</p>

            <h2 id="society" class="sub-title">AI in our society</h2>

            <p>Chat-GPT from OpenAI has made massive waves recently being a language model that you can have coherent conversations with released on March 14, 2023. However it has no come with out it's criticisms. A major one is it's accusation is bias. For example according to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/12/3/148">this study</a> Chat-GPT is biased towards left leaning views. Another example of Chat-GPT's bias is refusing to make jokes about women however complies to make jokes about men seen <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/chatgpt-won-t-crack-jokes-on-women-indians-netizens-left-guessing-why-11676171036353.html">here</a>.</p>
