        <p>Originally the internet was intended for the global communication of scientific material. However governments and companies with large monopolies have a death grip on the media. Content will be cencorced if it is of a certain nature however is it really moral to censor infomation sources, are we as individuals not able to determine what aligns with our personal values, because some kind of infomation could be hidden from us and the ruling party be that the government or company gains from hiding it.</p>
        <p>Tangentially related, it is becoming scarse for the guarantee of privacy. Infomation is a valuable commodity. If a company provides something for free then you're the product, your infomation is being harvested and sold. Many parties have an interest in the infomation and one of those parties may be the authorities. Mass surveillance. Your behaviour being monitored to check you don't step out of line and continue to act as in a way which doesn't harm the government.</p>

        <p>This video shows how hong kong citizens are rebelling against the surveillance by the governement to support democracy</p>
        <p>The internet has on one hand made it easy for people to pirate media. The authorities like to push the narative that this is immoral however should we really lock away infomation from people who can't pay. Would this not only increase the economic divide?</p>
