            <h1 class="title">Automated Decision Making</h1>

            <p>Automated Decision Making is technology being used to make decision based on a range of inputs, they usually aren't very easy decisions to make and often require a professional to make these decisions but you can analyze patterns in the inputs and the outputs and then use technology to reduce the involvement of the professional or completely replace them.</p>
            <p>One use of the automated decision making is in satnavs to plot a route that may be the fastest, the shortest route isn't always the fastest and the are so many details which add complexity to plotting the fastest route such as things like speed limit, traffic and road works however there are many more slightly more subtle details.
            <p>Another use of automated decision making is in health care, analyzing ultra sounds or x-rays looking for problems. These tools are known as Computer-aided diagnosis.
            <p>Automated decision making removes the involvement of people meaning it may be cheaper and easier to make on the spot decisions, however by replacing people you are putting them out of a job. The technology also wont always be correct, you will always need people to check perform a sanity check on what decision has been made or at least have a human overviewing the process.</p>
